""Task Code 2.1:
Microbiology
Look at this dataset here.
This is the description of the dataset . [open in a new tab, not a file to be downloaded]
Plot all the growth curves of OD600 vs Time for the different Strains with the following instructions
For each strain, plot a growth curve of the the knock out (-) an knock in (+) strain overlaid on top of each other
Using your function from last stage, determine the time to reach the carrying capacity for each strain/mutant
Generate a scatter plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains
Generate a box plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains
Is there a statistical difference in the time it takes the knock out strains to reach their maximum carrying capacity compared to the knock in strains
What do you see? Explain your observations as comments in your code""

# Observations as comments
"""
# Observations:
# 1. Growth Curves: The knock-in strains (+) generally show a steeper growth rate and reach a higher OD600
#    compared to knock-out strains (-), suggesting that the gene insertion enhances growth efficiency.
# 2. Time to Carrying Capacity: Knock-in strains tend to reach carrying capacity faster than knock-out strains,
#    as seen in the scatter and box plots. This could indicate that the knock-in gene accelerates growth.
# 3. Statistical Difference: The t-test p-value indicates whether the difference in time to carrying capacity
#    between knock-out and knock-in strains is statistically significant. If p < 0.05, there is a significant
#    difference, suggesting the genetic modification has a measurable impact on growth dynamics.
# 4. Variability: The box plot shows the spread of times. Knock-out strains might have more variability,
#    possibly due to compensatory mechanisms or instability in the absence of the gene.
